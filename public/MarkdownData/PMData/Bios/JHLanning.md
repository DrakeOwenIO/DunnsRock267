  J. H. Lanning was Dunn’s Rock Lodge’s eighth Master. There is very little information regarding Worshipful Brother Lanning. We do not have a date for his initiation but he was passed to the Degree of Fellow Craft on February 6th, 1880 and raised to the Sublime Degree on March 20th, 1880 in Dunn’s Rock Lodge. Worshipful Brother Lanning was installed as Master on June 24th of 1889 and served until June 24th of 1890. He is one of the two Past Masters that we do not have a photo of.
