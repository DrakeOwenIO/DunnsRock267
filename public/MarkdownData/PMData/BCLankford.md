Worshipful Brother Braxton Caldwell Lankford

Braxton Caldwell Lankford was born on December 19th 1824 near Columbus N.C. in Polk County. He was instrumental in the founding of our community; “Alex F. England, Leander S. Gash and Braxton C. Lankford jointly donated 50 acres for a new town site. Brevard grew slowly and started with only two or three stores, a new courthouse and county jail, two churches and a dozen residences.” Upon moving to what is now Brevard he bought a store then known as the Oak Grove Store and what was thence referred to as the Valley Store. It was located near what is now the Deer Lake Development.

Worshipful Brother Lankford was one of the signers of the petition requesting the establishment of the county which was passed on February 15th 1861. He was a merchant, postmaster (from 1882 to 1888), and Mayor of Brevard in 1892. He served in several capacities in the county offices such as; Chairman of the County Commissioners, Register of Deeds, Clerk of Chancery Court, Trustee of the Public Buildings and Justice of the Peace. It was at his store that the first court session was held in the new Transylvania County on May 20th 1861. Interestingly, on the same date in Raleigh N. C. there was a convention held at which it was voted to secede from the Union. News of this did not arrive in Brevard until the next day. He was one of the largest land owners in the town district of the county where he owned 116 acres in 1861.
