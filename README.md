# Dunns Rock Masonic Lodge \#267

A project to bring more light onto our lodge in the 21st century.

## A Short History
Having a website is something few lodges have. WB Jeffrey Owen, Computer Engineer from NCSU, forged the path for us in 2001. 
The site was updated occasionally through the years but the base remained the same. In 2014 access to update the site was lost and never regained.

In 2021 I was initated and, being an undergrad at Clemson for Computer Science, immediately wanted to update the site. I started playing with some ideas, but with just being an EA there wasn't much I could do as I had not yet received all the knowledge needed. After being raised in 2022 I started playing with ideas again but nothing ever came of it. 

This year I am Junior Warden and annouced to the lodge that I would update the site. We are nearing the end of the year and the end of my term as Junior Warden so I have finally began the road to bring our site into the modern day from 2001.

## Specs
I'm using React to create the base site with most of the data embedded into the site's files. The more long-term approach will be to have this fully fledged with a database and backend with the ability for users to update it without much technical knowledge needed. There are easier ways of going about this such as WordPress or SquareSpace but this is a passion project to improve my ability to work in React.
